Critique Final

Sophia - I've always been an Undertale enjoyer, so I really loved how she perfectly captured the game feel. The art stylization is also very unique, a lot more grimdark than the original. But the only thing I would change is that the phase between the enemy's turn and the player's turn is a bit strange. Specifically, when the player selects the attack option, the damage is automatically subtracted from the enemy's hp, but the player doesn't actually see it.

Luis - I think you really nailed a certain kind of vibe for this game. The music and the animation is great, and while I don't remember what the original game you were inspired by was, but I still adore everything you put into this. 

Debrief - I didn't do as well on this project as I would've liked, as I was never able to really figure out collision masks. I had some animations ready, but I accidentally broke the animations, and had to scrap the crafting mechanic altogether. I think there's a lot of potential for what I have, and there's a lot I want to do with it going froward. And while the final result isn't what I had in mind, I definitely see a lot of room to grow. When I made games before, I usually stuck to more action-oriented fighting games, like platformers or roguelites, so I thought Dave the Diver would be an interesting change of pace. Though I think that trying to juggle an entire crafting system, with also trying to implement monsters, killing, and a movement system with slow motion may have been a leap too far.
