Jiahe - This was a great job, I've always loved pong games. The art style is extremely aesthetically pleasing, and its overall a very calming experience. I would say that one thing you could consider tweaking in the future is increasing the bounciness of your colliders? Add a little feeling of "chaos" as the game keeps going.

Brandon - So while I like the aesthetic of your pinball game, I actually couldn't get past the start screen, which you may want to fix.

Sara - This is so adorable, I love it so much. This was one of the best twists on the pinball concept I saw, and the steam on the egg is just the best touch. In terms of improvements, I don't really see a lose condition, which would be something I think you could implement later?

Debrief - I think this was definitely the project I had the most fun with. Most of my issues I had with this was struggling with the flippers, but once I got collisions working, it was great just trying to make the bounciest and most annoying game I could. I think for me, personally, I love when pinball is high stress. The ball moving at high speed, bounding off everything, especially towards the end where you're just mashing the flippers. So yeah, I had a great time with this project. I think the other issue I ran into was attaching script methods to their object, which wasn't super fun either.
