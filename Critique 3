Critique 3

Ray - I said this before, but I love the energy of Ray's UI. I never saw the old version, only the remake, but even still, I think he really nailed the dark, gritty atmosphere in his UI. Though I think that also partially works against it, as it's hard to make out the actual text within the menus due to them being hard to see against the white grain of the background. I would suggest using either a different color or a harsher outline to make them harder to make out.

Sophia - The art is extremely cute. I feel like I'm about to play a minimalist game about managing a boutique, or a salon, or one of those cute, laid back retro games. The view is a bit too zoomed in, so I'm not sure what I'm either missing or not seeing, such as if there are other buttons apart from the START and EXIT button?

Leo - I love the background art of this one, and the moving title and fading background are amazing for setting the tone. The one minor suggestion I have is regarding the font of the title? The energy of the art and the vibe is a mystery/dungeon crawler type of game, but the font feels very... retro? A bit sillier compared to the energy of everything else. Otherwise, I love it!

Debrief - I got a lot of good notes about my menu, but overall I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I wanted to capture a grimdark atmosphere, and everyone seemed to pick up on it pretty quickly, which is a good sign that I did what I set out to accomplish. I think the one consistent note people had was about the stylistic choices I made regarding fonts and backgrounds. I tried sticking to only the Unity assets, but I think I definitely could've found a better font online. Like Chiller, or other horror-inspired fonts. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with how the final result turned out.
